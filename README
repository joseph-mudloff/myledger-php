This is a PHP front-end for datasets created with SQL-Ledger.

It is currently in the development stage, without much functionality.

It uses Justin Vincent's ezaql class for PostgreSQL, and the html_form PHP class from dyn-web.com.

The app framework is based on a custom CMS that I put together for web applications. It should be pretty easy to follow the process flow by looking at the main index.php and config.php files. I'm trying to be mindful about adding comments to make it easier.
